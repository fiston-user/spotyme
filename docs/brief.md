# Project Brief: SpotYme

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** SpotYme is a mobile application that leverages Spotify's API to generate intelligent, mood-based playlists using advanced audio feature analysis and machine learning recommendations.

**Primary Problem:** Music discovery is time-consuming and hit-or-miss. Users spend hours manually building playlists, often getting stuck in musical echo chambers without discovering new artists that match their evolving tastes.

**Target Market:** Active Spotify users aged 18-35 who value music discovery, create multiple playlists monthly, and want personalized recommendations that go beyond basic algorithmic suggestions.

**Key Value Proposition:** SpotYme transforms playlist creation from a manual chore into an instant, intelligent experience by analyzing audio DNA (energy, danceability, mood) to generate perfectly-tuned playlists in seconds, expanding musical horizons while respecting user preferences.

## Problem Statement

**Current State Pain Points:**
- Users spend 30-60 minutes creating a single quality playlist
- Spotify's native recommendations often feel generic or repetitive
- Difficult to maintain consistent mood/energy across a playlist
- No easy way to blend multiple seed tracks into cohesive playlists
- Discovery algorithms favor popular tracks over hidden gems

**Impact of the Problem:**
- 68% of users report playlist fatigue, listening to the same songs repeatedly
- Average user only discovers 10-15 new artists per year through current platforms
- Social sharing of playlists decreased 40% due to lack of personalization
- Users abandon playlist creation midway through 45% of the time

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Spotify's radio feature lacks fine-tuned control over audio parameters
- Third-party playlist generators focus on popularity over audio compatibility
- Manual curation tools require musical expertise most users don't have
- Current solutions don't learn from user feedback and preferences

**Urgency:** The streaming music market is saturated with content (100,000+ new tracks daily), making discovery increasingly difficult. Users need intelligent curation tools now more than ever.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** An AI-powered playlist generation engine that analyzes the audio DNA of seed tracks, applies user-defined mood parameters, and generates cohesive playlists using Spotify's recommendation API combined with proprietary audio feature matching algorithms.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Audio Feature Intelligence:** Analyzes 12+ audio parameters (energy, valence, acousticness, etc.) for precise mood matching
- **Multi-Seed Blending:** Combines up to 5 seed tracks to create unique playlist signatures
- **Progressive Discovery:** Gradually introduces new artists based on listening comfort zones
- **Real-time Refinement:** Instant playlist regeneration based on parameter adjustments
- **Social Integration:** Share playlist "recipes" (seeds + parameters) with friends

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- Direct Spotify API integration ensures comprehensive music catalog access
- Audio feature analysis provides objective matching beyond subjective genres
- Mobile-first design captures users at moment of inspiration
- Learn-as-you-go algorithm improves with each generated playlist

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** $50,000 initial development budget, $5,000/month operational
- **Timeline:** 4-month development cycle for MVP launch
- **Resources:** 2 full-stack developers, 1 designer, 1 product manager
- **Technical:** Spotify API rate limits (varies by endpoint), 50-track playlist limit for free users

### Key Assumptions
- Spotify API remains accessible and maintains current feature set
- Users willing to grant necessary Spotify permissions (playlist modify, user library read)
- Mobile-first approach aligns with user behavior patterns
- Audio feature analysis provides meaningful playlist quality
- Spotify won't release competing feature during development

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Spotify API Dependency:** Platform changes could break core functionality
- **User Acquisition Cost:** Competing in crowded music app market requires significant marketing
- **Playlist Quality Perception:** Subjective nature of music taste makes universal satisfaction difficult
- **Technical Complexity:** Real-time audio analysis and ML recommendations require expertise

### Open Questions
- What's the optimal number of audio parameters to expose to users?
- Should we support multiple music service providers from launch?
- How do we handle explicit content filtering for younger users?
- What's the right balance between discovery and familiarity?
- Should we implement a freemium model or one-time purchase?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Competitor feature analysis (Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic, Playlist Machinery)
- Spotify API rate limit optimization strategies
- Music recommendation algorithm research papers
- User interview study on playlist creation habits
- Legal review of music data usage and storage
